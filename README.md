# Work-Day-Scheduler

*work in progress*

## Description

The goal was to add jquery to an existing site that allows the user to save tasks for each hour of the day. I had to lookup documentation for both Jquery and dayjs because of the time and date aspect to this assignment. The site is almost fully functional with persistent localstorage even after closing the page. The current date and time is also functional and is displayed at the top of the page. The current hour is supposed to be highlighted in red, the past hours in gray, and the future hours in green. I am still figuring out how to fix this issue. I still need to look into how dayjs makes comparisons against other times.

## Usage

Type in your task for the hour and click the save button to save your task. The task will be saved in local storage and will be there when you refresh the page. The current hour will be highlighted in red, the past hours will be highlighted in gray, and the future hours will be highlighted in green. The console will show the current time and date and some over console logs that were used for testing.
